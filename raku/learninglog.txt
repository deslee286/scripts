Installed raku, binary is perl6
Installed zef using instructions on zef module in https://github.com/ugexe/zef
Installed XML library using zef install XML
Tested using sample code

Getting Perl6 mode on emacs:
git clone https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package.git ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/use-package
cd .emacs.d/site-lisp/use-package/

installed make, ran make for use-package. Some docs failed to be created, ignored
modified .emacs to add:

(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)



(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/use-package")
(require 'use-package)

(with-eval-after-load 'info
  (info-initialize)
  (add-to-list 'Info-directory-list
               "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/use-package/"))


(use-package perl6-mode
  :ensure t
  :defer t
)
Then ran M-x package-initialize

Evaluated the (use-package perl6-mode... and it enters perl6 mode upon editing .p6 files
